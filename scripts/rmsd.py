"""
Compute global RMSD for aligned protein structure pairs.

This module reorders ground-truth and inferred Bio.PDB Structure objects by their
structure IDs, aligns each inferred structure to its corresponding ground truth using
global CA atom alignment (ignoring chain boundaries), and computes the global RMSD for
each alignment. Additionally, it determines whether the structure is a monomer or a multimer
(based on the number of chains in the ground truth).

Example usage in a Jupyter Notebook:
    from rmsd_table import compute_alignment_rmsd_table
    results = compute_alignment_rmsd_table(ground_truth_structures, inferred_list)
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(results)
    display(df)
